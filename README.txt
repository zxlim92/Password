assignment: Password Validator and Generator

User needs to open a python IDE or a terminal to run this code. If using terminal in ubuntu, write python3 password_validator.py.
If using IDE just run the script by copy and pasting the scipt into the ide and runining it. 

To gernerate a certain length password change the password = generate(n) where n is the number of characters the password 
has. This program assumes tat the user will put a n value greater or equal to 8 for it to always generate a secure password.

For the validate function, you can validate the generated password by leaving it as validate(password) or, if the user wants to
validate their own password, change password to the users string, eg validate("passwordHere"). The return would tell you if the
pasword is secure or insecure or invalid.

if code doesnt run try clearing the terminal as i have encountered errors and by fixing it i typed clear in console.
